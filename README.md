# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game written in Java. The game allows a human player to play against an AI opponent.

## Features

- **Human vs. AI Gameplay**: The game supports a player-versus-computer mode where a human player competes against an AI opponent.
- **Randomized AI Moves**: The AI opponent makes randomized moves within the available empty spaces on the board.
- **Win Detection**: The game detects when either player achieves a win by forming a line of three consecutive marks either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- **Draw Detection**: If no player wins and the board is full, the game declares a draw.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: The game has a clean and simple graphical interface built using Java Swing.

## How to Play

1. Run the `TicTacToeGUI.java` file to start the game.
2. Click on any empty space on the 3x3 grid to make your move.
3. The game alternates between the human player and the AI player until a win or draw condition is met.
4. A message box will appear to declare the winner or if the game is a draw. After that, the game will reset.
